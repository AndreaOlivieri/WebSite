  Since_I_was_a_little_boy_I_feel_a: "Since I was a little boy I feel a strong interest for the computer that led me to follow an informatic career. I've moved my first steps at G. Armellini technical institute of Rome where I’ve started to program using Java. The most important experience I made in high school has been an european project for information security in conjunction with a turkish and spanish high school. In 2010 I obtained the ECDL and diploma. After high school, I enrolled at Roma Tre university in computer engineering faculty. In 2013, after passing all exams, I did an internship at ISTC-CNR where I developed a desktop application to a robotic platform with the aim of analyzing the person's posture and balance through three simple exercises engines. The application was developed in C# and worked closely with the Kinect sensor for tracking posture. In the summer of 2013, less than three years after enrollment, I achieved my bachelor's degree in computer engineering. As new graduate I decided to do my first working experience at H.S.C. company where I learned Delphi programming language in order to develop its enterprise software and PL-SQL to query Oracle databases. After one year I left the company to start studying full-time again for master degree in computer engineering. Meanwhile I focused my attention in startup's world where I tried to create my own startup in two different events, first one has been the ‘startup weekend 2014’ of Rome with ‘Showay’ team and then ‘InnovAction Lab 2015’ with ‘Fashape’ team. In summer of 2015 I came back to work as web developer in The City srls real estate agency where I developed its website. This work experience gives me the opportunity to learn Ruby on Rails and fly to Los Angeles. Back to Rome I decided to left the real estate agency and finish my master degree."
